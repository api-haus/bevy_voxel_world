## Flow State Design

### Onboarding Flow (First 5 Minutes)

| Time      | Player Action            | Game Response                | Learning Objective |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0:00-0:30 | Start game               | Immediate gameplay (no menu) | Reduce friction    |
| 0:30-1:00 | First input              | Exaggerated response         | Input correlation  |
| 1:00-2:00 | Complete micro-challenge | Celebration feedback         | Success feeling    |
| 2:00-3:00 | Encounter first failure  | Quick restart                | Failure is safe    |
| 3:00-5:00 | Complete first level     | Unlock progression           | Investment hook    |

### Difficulty Progression

```
Skill Floor ────────────────────────── Skill Ceiling
    │                                          │
    ├─ Tutorial (5 min)                       │
    ├─── Easy Mode (2 hrs) ──────             │
    ├───── Normal Mode (10 hrs) ──────────    │
    ├─────── Hard Mode (20 hrs) ─────────────┤
    └──────── Master Mode (∞) ────────────────┘
```

### Challenge Scaling Methods

1. **Complexity Increase**:
   - Level 1-10: Single mechanic focus
   - Level 11-20: Two mechanic combinations
   - Level 21+: Full mechanic symphony

2. **Time Pressure**:
   - Optional initially
   - Gradually introduced
   - Always has pressure-free mode

3. **Precision Requirements**:
   - Generous hitboxes early
   - Tighter tolerances later
   - Visual clarity always maintained

## Player Retention Design

### Hook Hierarchy

**Micro Hooks (Seconds)**:
- Satisfying sound effects
- Smooth animations
- Particle effects on success

**Macro Hooks (Minutes)**:
- "Just one more level" design
- Cliffhanger level endings
- Visible next objective

**Meta Hooks (Sessions)**:
- Daily challenges
- Leaderboard updates
- New content unlocks

### Memorable Moments

Design for "Remember when..." stories:

1. **The First "Aha!"**: [Describe the moment players first "get it"]
2. **The Impossible Made Possible**: [A challenge that seems unfair but isn't]
3. **The Creative Solution**: [When players find unintended solutions]
4. **The Perfect Run**: [When everything clicks together]
