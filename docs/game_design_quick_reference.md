# Game Design Assistant Quick Reference

## How to Use the Game Design Assistant

### 1. Starting a New Game Concept

**Prompt Example**:
> "I have an idea for a [genre] game about [theme/mechanic]. Help me evaluate if this could create engaging, long-lasting gameplay using the flow state and retention principles."

**What You'll Get**:
- Flow state analysis of your concept
- Retention mechanics evaluation  
- Simplification suggestions
- Cost-benefit analysis

### 2. Developing Core Gameplay Loop

**Prompt Example**:
> "Help me design the core 30-second gameplay loop for my [game concept]. Focus on immediate engagement and natural skill progression."

**What You'll Get**:
- Structured loop breakdown
- Timing recommendations
- Feedback system design
- Difficulty scaling options

### 3. Creating Game Design Document

**Prompt Example**:
> "I need to create a game design document for [game name]. Help me structure it using the GDD template, starting with [section]."

**What You'll Get**:
- Section-by-section guidance
- Specific examples for your game
- Priority recommendations
- Scope management advice

### 4. Prototype Planning

**Prompt Example**:
> "Help me plan a greybox prototype for [game concept] that demonstrates the core fun in 15-20 minutes of gameplay."

**What You'll Get**:
- Feature prioritization
- Technical scope definition
- Success metrics
- Testing methodology

## Common Prompts Library

### Concept Validation
> "Validate this game concept against the 10-year replayability test: [concept]"

### Mechanic Analysis
> "Analyze this mechanic for flow state potential: [mechanic description]"

### Competitive Analysis
> "Compare my game [description] to [competitor]. What's my unique value?"

### Scope Management
> "I have [X] months and [Y] budget. What features should I cut from: [feature list]"

### Player Psychology
> "How can I make [mechanic/moment] more memorable and shareable?"

### Monetization Ethics
> "Evaluate this monetization model for fairness and long-term player trust: [model]"

### Technical Constraints
> "Adapt this design for [platform] limitations: [constraint list]"

## Red Flags to Watch For

When the assistant warns about:

ðŸš© **Complexity Creep**
- More than 3 core mechanics
- Tutorial needs exceed 5 minutes
- Can't explain in elevator pitch

ðŸš© **Scope Explosion**  
- Feature list grows weekly
- "Nice to have" becomes "essential"
- Timeline keeps extending

ðŸš© **Flow Breakers**
- Forced interruptions
- Complex menus during play
- Long loading/waiting times

ðŸš© **Retention Risks**
- Relies on extrinsic rewards only
- No clear progression path
- Punishes returning players
